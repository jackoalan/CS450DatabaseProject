# Vue Client developed by Nico Del Moral

This vue.js client works with node.js and is configured to hit the HTTP endpoints at localhost:8080.  Axios, a promise-based HTTP client was used to make simple CRUD operations to interact with data through the Python backend.  ApexCharts, a JavaScript graphic charts library, was incorporated to display a graphical interface for the data received through the JSON protocol.
